  content: |
    The Design Blocks can be used without Forestry but to harness the power
    of Blocks we recommend using <a href="https://forestry.io">Forestry</a>. Once the site is imported you can immediately
    create new sites and make them fully customizable.

\## _Nikhil Bhagwat_

I am a post-doc at McGill University working with \[Dr. Jean-Baptiste Poline\]([https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/jean-baptiste-poline-phd](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/jean-baptiste-poline-phd "https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/jean-baptiste-poline-phd")) in the \[ORIGAMI\]([https://neurodatascience.github.io/](https://neurodatascience.github.io/ "https://neurodatascience.github.io/")) lab. My current work focuses on improving reproducibility and sustainability of computational neuroimaging pipelines. I completed my PhD thesis on prognostic applications for Alzheimer’s disease using MR imaging and machine-learning techniques under \[Dr. Mallar Chakravarty\]([http://cobralab.ca/members/commander/](http://cobralab.ca/members/commander/ "http://cobralab.ca/members/commander/")) at the University of Toronto. Subsequently, I worked as a researcher on a collaborative project between McGill and UMass universities on computational pipelines to perform methodological vibration analysis and improve reproducibility. I then went on to work at the \[Allen Institute\]([https://alleninstitute.org/](https://alleninstitute.org/ "https://alleninstitute.org/")), where I developed segmentation techniques and network spread models for quantifying cellular pathologies of Alzheimer’s disease in high-resolution microscopy data. I am an open-science enthusiast, and have been involved in several workshops and \[educational courses\]([https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/SDC-BIDS-sMRI](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/SDC-BIDS-sMRI "https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/SDC-BIDS-sMRI")). My diverse work experiences over the last few years have made me increasingly aware of the environmental and ecological impact of neuroimaging pipelines stemming from exponential growth of computational research - making it the current focus of my work.
